# BattleGrid_TICTACTOE
### Battle Grid: Tic Tac Toe

Battle Grid is an advanced, strategy-based version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.
Instead of placing moves directly on the main board, players must first win a sub-game to earn their move — making gameplay more competitive, tactical, and engaging.

## Features

Two-player gameplay (Player X vs Player O)

Main board with interactive sub-game mechanics

Sub-game modal system to determine main-board moves

Smart turn handling and move validation

Real-time win and draw detection for both boards

Game reset functionality

Clean and responsive UI

Fully interactive logic using JavaScript

## Gameplay Rules

Players take turns selecting a cell on the main board

Selecting a cell opens a sub-board game

Winning the sub-game allows the player to place their symbol on the chosen main-board cell

If the sub-game ends in a draw, no move is placed

The first player to win on the main board wins the Battle Grid game
